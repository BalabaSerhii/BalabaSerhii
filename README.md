## Hiüëã My name is Sergey

<h3 align="left">üë©‚Äçüíª About Me
</h3>

<p align="left">I am a motivated and continuously learning developer with a strong focus on front-end development. While my main passion lies in working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I am also capable of handling back-end tasks using Node.js when needed.

I have completed a full-stack developer course, where I gained practical experience in:

HTML & CSS: Crafting responsive and modern web designs using Flexbox, forms, and various decorative elements.
JavaScript: Mastering core concepts such as arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await), and HTTP requests.
React: Building interactive and dynamic web applications with React hooks, Redux Toolkit for state management, and React Router for navigation.
Node.js: Developing RESTful APIs using Express and MongoDB, implementing authentication, and managing data validation and pagination.
TypeScript: Working with TypeScript for reliable, strongly-typed code in both front-end and back-end projects.
I am proficient in German at the B1 level and English at the A2 level, with Ukrainian and Russian as my native languages. Though I am not yet a professional, I dedicate myself to learning and improving every day, refining my skills across both front-end and back-end technologies.

I am eager to join a company that values continuous learning, collaboration, and innovation, where I can grow while contributing to exciting projects. If your company seeks a developer with a passion for front-end and a readiness to tackle full-stack challenges, I would love to be part of your team.
